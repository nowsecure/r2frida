Radare2 and Frida better together.

![logo](r2frida.png)

Description
-----------
One of the main aims of the radare project is to provide a complete
toolchain for reverse engineering, providing well maintained functionalities
and extend its features with other programming languages and tools.

Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit that makes it easy to inspect and
manipulate running processes by injecting your own JavaScript, and optionally
also communicate with your scripts.

For more information about those projects:

Installation
------------

In GNU/Debian you will need to install the following packages:

	$ sudo apt install -y make gcc libzip-dev nodejs npm curl pkg-config git

The recommended way to install r2frida is via r2pm:

	$ r2pm -ci r2frida

But you can always follow the standard way in here:

	$ git clone https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida.git
	$ make ; make install

Usage:
------
r2frida is used from r2 by specifying a process name:

	$ r2 frida://Twitter

Or a PID:

	$ r2 frida://1234

Or the absolute path of a binary to spawn:

	$ r2 frida:///bin/ls

also with arguments:

	$ r2 frida://"/bin/ls -al"

Alternatively also with a device ID that you retrieved through frida-ls-devices:

	$ r2 frida://device-id/Twitter

you can spawn an app on the device too, with an extra `/` and the package name (you can retrieve package names with frida-ps):

	$ r2 frida://device-id//com.atebits.Tweetie2

Termux
------
If you are willing to install and use r2frida natively on Android via Termux, there are some caveats with the library dependencies because of some symbol resolutions. The way to make this work is by extending the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment to point to the system directory *before* the termux libdir.

`$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/system/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH r2 frida://...`

To debug plugin loading problems use the following environment variable and grep for `frida`:

`$ R_DEBUG=1 r2 -`

This tool has been developed by pancake aka Sergi Alvarez for NowSecure.

I would like to thank Ole Andr√© for being so nice answering and fix
bugs in Frida without those patches that would not be possible.
